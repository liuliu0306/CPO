# Laboratory work description
Lab1 includes the definition of unrolled linked list data structure and the implementation of data structure related mutable algorithms.
We implemented at least 18 methods. Then we test the data structure and its algorithms using unit tests and PBT tests. 
After GitHub active, we passed all tests.


## Project structure

- `UnrolledLinkedList.py` -- implementation of `UnrolledLinkedList` and `Node` class with more than 18 methods.
   
- `ull_test.py` -- unit and PBT tests for `UnrolledLinkedList`.

- .github/workflows/check.yml -- for GitHub active.

## Contribution
- Liu Riheng 
   1.Define data structures and implement basic methods such as adding, deleting, traversal, etc.
   2.Implement `ull_test.py` which include unit and PBT tests.
   3.Complete readme and GitHub active.
- Chen Weite
   1.Implement other methods of UnrolledLinkedList.
   2.Check code style and unify code formatting.
   3.Collect the resources required by lab1, including the use of software, the description of data structure.
